    "As you know, you have hired me as a consultant to help you collect and summarize appropriate data to be used in a marketing advertisement that makes a comparison between our company “Pizza Hut” and our main competitor “Domino’s Pizza”\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively compare our Pizza Hut with our competitor Domino’s Pizza, I recommend the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.We will identify the company’s strengths:**\n",
    "1. Quality of ingredients: We can use higher-quality ingredients, such as fresh mozzarella cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes.\n",
    "2. Speed of service: We could offer a faster delivery service or a shorter wait time in the store.\n",
    "3. Level of customer satisfaction: We can also offer a loyalty program or a customer satisfaction guarantee.\n",
    "4. Customer Experience: We can focus on its overall customer experience. This could include things like the atmosphere of the store, the friendliness of the staff, and the cleanliness of the environment.\n",
    "5. Price: Offering reasonable price to our customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.We should develop research questions such as:**\n",
    "- Quality of ingredients:\n",
    "     - Do our customers rate the quality of our ingredients higher than our competitor’s?\n",
    "     - Are our customers more likely to recommend our pizza to others because of the quality of our ingredients?\n",
    "- Speed of service:\n",
    "    - How long does it take us to deliver pizzas compared to our competitor?\n",
    "    - How long does it take us to prepare pizzas in the store compared to our competitor?\n",
    "    - Are our customers more satisfied with the speed of our service than our competitor’s?\n",
    "- \tLevel of customer satisfaction:\n",
    "    - How satisfied are our customers with our pizza overall?\n",
    "    - How likely are our customers to return to our store?\n",
    "    - How likely are our customers to recommend our pizza to others?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Collect data through following ways:**\n",
    "- **Surveys**: Surveys are a great way to collect data from a large number of people. Our company Pizza Hut could create a survey and ask our customers to complete it. The survey could ask questions about the customer's satisfaction with the quality of the ingredients, the speed of the service, and the overall customer experience.\n",
    "- **Interviews**:  We should interview our customers to get their feedback on the quality of the ingredients, the speed of the service, and the overall customer experience.\n",
    "- **Focus groups**: Focus groups are a good way to get feedback from a group of people. We can hold a focus group with our customers to get their feedback on the quality of the ingredients, the speed of the service, and the overall customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have collected the necessary data, perform a comprehensive analysis to compare Pizza Hut performance against our main competitor Domino’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Summarize the data: Once we have collected our data, then we need to summarize it in a way that is clear and easy to understand. This could involve using graphs, or charts.**\n",
    "Graphs: Graphs are a great way to summarize data that is visual. For example, our company could create a graph that shows the results of a survey of its customers about their satisfaction with the speed of the service. The graph could show the average time it took to deliver pizzas, the average time it took to prepare pizzas in the store, and the percentage of customers who were satisfied with the speed of the service. We can compare our company's performance with that of our competitors by using a side-by-side bar chart. This visual representation provides quick data visualization and highlights areas where our company is doing good and the area where we need improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Writing an advertisement:**\n",
    "\"Headline: Are you tired of eating the same old pizza?\"\n",
    "If you're looking for a better pizza experience, look no further than Pizza Hut. We use only the freshest ingredients, and our pizzas are made to order. We also offer a variety of toppings and crusts to choose from, so you can create the perfect pizza for your taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent survey, our customers rated us higher than our competitor on the following factors:\n",
    "Quality of ingredients\n",
    "Speed of service\n",
    "Overall customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "We're confident that you'll be happy with our pizza, and we offer a satisfaction guarantee. So, what are you waiting for? Order your pizza today from Pizza Hut!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Call to action: Order your pizza today from Pizza Hut!**\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that this approach would be the most effective way to conduct a study that supports claims focusing on our company’s strengths. I am confident that the data I collect will help you to write a marketing advertisement that will be persuasive to potential customers.\n",
